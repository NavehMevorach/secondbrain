                Imagine a place where people can meet to learn, anytime,
                anywhere. Not by listening to vague theories written on a
                blackboard, but rather a class where people are teaching each
                other by tackling real-world challenges together. A place where
                real teamwork is needed for solving simulated problems so that
                people from all over the world can advance their professional
                skills and reach their career goals by being part of a curious,
                profession-focused learning community.
